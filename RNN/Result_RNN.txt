You tell them they will never apologize and instead get Mad at you. Management pls check on your people.

Shannon and her team are incredibly welcoming as well as being experts on the Pure Barre technique. The convenient location in Hilldale near lululemon, Anthropologie, and Metcalfes is awesome!! I love the great retail brands the studio carries, too - especially ALO and Beyond Yoga. Definitely a must try for those looking to increase strength and flexibility!!!

I have eaten here on numerous occasions, both late night and for brunch. Though it seems the service has been put last on the list. 45+ minutes for two eggs and grits on a sunday at 2pm is inconceivable with over 10 people on wait staff, and I ended up taking my order to go which had not a single thing I ordered correct, and no utensils or napkins.

food in very sushi time . . ' at to out	My wife and I tried it for the first time yesterday. Not impressed, we ordered some sushi, the sushi was plain and not much to it. Waiter didn't even ask if we wanted cocktails. Simply nothing to come back for, we didn't try anything else. One and out for us! The operation seemed very sloppy and disorganized. We witness 3 tables leave bc of the long wait for their food. We waited 30 mins for our appetizer, which was edamame. Anyhow, under the right management it may survive. Good luck!

The guy tried telling me it was on sale everything in the store has a green tag on it. But it didn't have a top on it and it ended up not working. I go to the other side of the counter to see if there was something else I wanted and I hear the guy talking crap about me to another customer. They have no respect.

Eat your money back unless you are a monster. Go the easier route and add champagne to your meal instead. It costs $7 more but you get unlimited champagne, mimosas, our bloody Mary's. You can also mix the champagne with some of the juices they have available at the buffet.
